I'm a digital colorist from Buenos Aires, Argentina based in Berlin. I graduated as Director of Photography from ENERC, a renowned film school from Buenos Aires in 2009. Since then I worked as a camera operator and assistant until 2013 when I started my career in color grading at the postproduction company Cine Chromatix in Berlin. There I had the chance to grade many beautiful films for Cinema and TV. Since 2016 I work as a freelance colorist for feature films and advertising. I also direct and produce my own experimental films.
