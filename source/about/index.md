Delfina is a passionate colorist based in Berlin. Growing up in a family of artists, she loved to watch her mother paint on canvas and mix colors. Delfina's own interest for art blossomed, leading her to study still photography before entering film school. She graduated in 2009 from the director of photography program at ENERC, a renowned Buenos Aires film school. She then worked as a camera operator and assistant before moving to Germany.

After initially joining an important Berlin post-production facility in 2013 grading dailies and short films, Delfina was soon entrusted with fulltime coloring duties on many big features, one of which, "Der Metzger", won the 2015 German cinematography prize.

With a special understanding and sensitivity for moving images, stemming from her cinematography background and her lifelong love for art, Delfina now enjoys working in a wide range of aesthetics. Her versatile skillset enables her to grade all formats, from cinema and TV feature films to short films, commercials, music videos and fashion films. She also directs and produces her own experimental films.

Delfina works with Da Vinci Resolve and Assimilate Scratch. You can book her into your grading suite or join her at her own suite in Berlin-Neukölln. She is open to travel and looking forward to exciting new projects.
